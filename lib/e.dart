/// A library for working with Euler's number (`e`).
///
/// This library provides a class `E` that allows you to perform a variety of
/// mathematical operations using Euler's number as a base. It includes support
/// for basic arithmetic, bitwise operations, and more, leveraging the special
/// properties of `e`.
///
/// ## Features:
/// - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
/// - Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
/// - Power and modulus operations
/// - Integer division and shifting operations
///
/// Use this library to explore the fascinating world of `e` and its applications
/// in mathematical computations.
